  "landing.blog.post1.content1": "Feature-first architecture is a pattern where code is organized by features rather than by technical concerns. Instead of grouping all components, hooks, and services in separate directories, each feature contains everything it needs to function independently.",
  "landing.blog.post1.content2": "In our template, each feature lives under src/features/<name>/ and contains its own components, hooks, services, schemas, guards, types, and a barrel index.ts file. This approach makes it easy to find related code and understand the boundaries of each feature.",
  "landing.blog.post1.content3": "Barrel exports via index.ts files provide a clean public API for each feature. Components outside the feature only import from the barrel, never from internal paths. This enforces encapsulation and makes refactoring safer since internal changes don't break external consumers.",
  "landing.blog.post1.content4": "As your team grows, feature-first architecture scales naturally. New developers can work on their feature in isolation without needing to understand the entire codebase. Features can be developed, tested, and even lazy-loaded independently, leading to better performance and developer experience.",
  "landing.blog.post2.content1": "Building a type-safe API client starts with defining your API contract using TypeScript interfaces. By leveraging generics, you can create a single fetch wrapper that automatically infers request and response types based on the endpoint being called.",
  "landing.blog.post2.content2": "Zod schemas serve as the bridge between runtime data and TypeScript types. Each API response is validated through a Zod schema before being used in the application. This catches malformed data at the boundary rather than letting it cause cryptic errors deep in your component tree.",
  "landing.blog.post2.content3": "TanStack Query handles the caching, deduplication, and background refetching layers. When combined with a typed API client, every useQuery and useMutation call provides full type inference from the query key to the rendered component.",
  "landing.blog.post2.content4": "The result is an API layer where TypeScript catches mistakes at compile time, Zod catches them at runtime, and TanStack Query optimizes the network layer — all working together seamlessly to provide a reliable data-fetching experience.",
  "landing.blog.post3.content1": "Implementing internationalization in a statically exported Next.js application requires a different approach than server-rendered apps. Without access to server-side middleware or headers, we rely on URL-based locale routing using a [locale] dynamic segment.",
  "landing.blog.post3.content2": "Translation files are stored as JSON in the public directory and loaded on the client side using TanStack Query. This approach leverages browser caching — once a locale file is loaded, subsequent page navigations are instant since the translations are already in the query cache.",
  "landing.blog.post3.content3": "The generateStaticParams function at the layout level ensures that every page is pre-rendered for each supported locale. Combined with the static export output mode, this produces a fully static site with separate HTML files for each locale-page combination.",
  "landing.blog.post3.content4": "Multi-tab synchronization via BroadcastChannel ensures that when a user switches language in one tab, all other tabs update immediately. This provides a seamless experience without requiring a page refresh or server round-trip.",
  "landing.blog.post4.content1": "Role-based access control (RBAC) is essential for any application with different user types. In our implementation, we use a combination of route guards, permission checks, and UI-level rendering control to create a comprehensive authorization system.",
  "landing.blog.post4.content2": "Route guards are React components that wrap protected pages. The AuthGuard checks if the user is authenticated, while permission-based guards check if the user has the required role or permission. If the check fails, the user is redirected to an appropriate page.",
  "landing.blog.post4.content3": "On the UI level, conditional rendering based on permissions ensures users only see actions they can perform. A user without the 'delete:users' permission won't see the delete button, reducing confusion and preventing unauthorized action attempts.",
  "landing.blog.post4.content4": "The key insight is that client-side guards are for UX, not security. True authorization must happen on the server. Our guards prevent accidental access and provide a polished experience, but the API layer always performs its own permission checks regardless of what the client sends.",

  "landing.faqs.title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "landing.faqs.subtitle": "Find answers to common questions about our platform.",
  "landing.faqs.item1.question": "What technologies does this template use?",
  "landing.faqs.item1.answer": "This template is built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, Zod for validation, and Zustand for state management. It uses MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking during development.",
  "landing.faqs.item2.question": "Is this template suitable for production use?",
  "landing.faqs.item2.answer": "This template is designed as a starting point for production applications. It includes authentication, authorization, i18n, and admin features out of the box. However, you should replace the MSW mock backend with your actual API before deploying to production.",
  "landing.faqs.item3.question": "How does authentication work?",
  "landing.faqs.item3.answer": "Authentication uses token-based sessions stored in sessionStorage. The auth flow includes login, registration, password reset with OTP verification, and automatic token refresh. Route guards protect authenticated pages, and the Zustand auth store manages the global auth state.",
  "landing.faqs.item4.question": "Can I add more languages?",
  "landing.faqs.item4.answer": "Yes! Simply create a new JSON translation file in public/locales/ (e.g., de.json for German), add the locale code to the SUPPORTED_LOCALES array in the i18n configuration, and the system will automatically generate static pages for the new locale.",
  "landing.faqs.item5.question": "How do I deploy this application?",
  "landing.faqs.item5.answer": "Since the app uses static export, you can deploy the generated out/ directory to any static hosting provider such as Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3 + CloudFront, or GitHub Pages. Run 'npm run build' to generate the static files.",
  "landing.faqs.item6.question": "What is the feature-first architecture?",
  "landing.faqs.item6.answer": "Feature-first architecture organizes code by business feature rather than technical concern. Each feature (auth, admin, i18n, etc.) lives in its own directory under src/features/ with its own components, hooks, services, and types. This makes the codebase easier to navigate and scale.",
  "landing.faqs.item7.question": "How do I customize the theme?",
  "landing.faqs.item7.answer": "The template uses Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS custom properties for theming. You can modify the color tokens in your CSS file to change the entire look and feel. The theme toggle supports light and dark modes with system preference detection and multi-tab synchronization.",
  "landing.faqs.item8.question": "Is the admin panel role-based?",
  "landing.faqs.item8.answer": "Yes, the admin panel uses role-based access control (RBAC). Users are assigned roles, and roles have specific permissions. Route guards and UI-level checks ensure users only see and access features they're authorized to use. The admin can manage users, roles, and permissions.",
